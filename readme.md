[![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=adinandradrs_codefun-common&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=adinandradrs_codefun-common)

Code4Fun Common is a common library that **used as a code layout and a template for coding style**. Code4Fun Common serves a service interface that strictly implements SRP (Single Responsibility Interface) for business logic and data transformation. Every process will be execute in a single handy method using a single input, and will be only produce a single output. 

It also applies for model structure such as : 
* entity for data model.
* request as input model.
* response as output model.  
* provide some of common model classes that can be re-used without re-ivent similar codes. 

Here is the minimum requirements to use this library
1. Lombok
1. JDK v11
1. Spring (Spring Data JPA and Swagger Docs) 

## Installation

Use the maven command [mvn](https://maven.org/) to install Code4Fun.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>id.codefun.common</groupId>
    <artifactId>codefun-common</artifactId>
    <version>${codefun-common.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

## Usage

Request model class
```java
@Data
@Builder
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
public class MyRequest extends BaseRequest {

    //attributes

}
```

Response model class
```java
@Data
@Builder
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
public class MyResponse extends BaseResponse {

    //attributes

}
```

Data model class
```java
@Data
@Builder
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
public class MyData extends BaseEntity {

    //attributes

}
```

Business logic class
```java
public class MyService implements BaseService<MyRequest, MyResponse> {

    public MyResponse execute(MyRequest request) {
        return ...
    }

}
```

Data transformation class e.g from data model to request model
```java
public class MyTransformation implements MessageTransformer<MyModel, MyRequest> {

    public MyRequest transform(MyModel input) {
        return ...
    }

}
```
